          <p>
            Spotify Music is one of the most trusted production music libraries
            in the world.&nbsp;With a wide variety of high-quality music and
            world-class customer service, we have clients from all over the
            world who use our music in everything from personal web videos to
            major network television broadcasts and major feature films.&nbsp;In
            addition to the music that we provide to our clients, Spotifty Music

            In 2013 Spotifty Music entered into an agreement with YouTube that
            revolutionizes how people use music and videos on the
            internet.&nbsp;Under this new agreement, all the tracks in the
            Spotifty Music library will be&nbsp;<strong>FREE</strong>&nbsp;for
            use on YouTube (personal use only).
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, we here at Spotifty Music care deeply about the
            music we provide and the customers who utilize our
            services.&nbsp;We've designed our website to provide the most
            accessible and easy-to-understand licensing process possible, and
            our hands-on customer support is always glad to assist whenever
